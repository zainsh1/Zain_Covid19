# Covid-19 Data by Zain Shareef

## Project Overview
- Data exploration using Microsoft SQL Server database to answer questions regards infections, deaths and vaccinations. The Dataset was taken from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
- SQL queries available
- Visualization the queries in a dashboard using Tableau.


## Objectives
Create a dashboard to visualize, interact and answer those questions:
* What are the numbers globally regards cases and deaths?
* Which continent has been more affected? And which one has more deaths?
* What is the percentage of death by country? How big is this percentage comparing by continent? And what about the infections?
* How well each country is doing regarding the vaccination numbers?

## Visualizations
The dashboard is available [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zain.shareef7417/viz/Covid-19Dashboard_16879296650820/Covid-19Dashboard?publish=yes).
* It is possible to filter by continent as well as by country.

## Conclusions
Through the dashboard it can be easily seen:
* Europe has been the most affected continent regards deaths.
* Comparing the entire World, Peru has registered the highest death rate (0.609%). If it compares only North America (for example), United States leads the death rate (0.253%).
* Comparing the entire World, Andorra has registered the highest infection rate (36.90%). If it compares only South America (for example), Argentina leads the infection rate (14.33%).
* Gibraltar has registered the highest percentage of vaccination number per population (257.6%), which means it applied vaccines more than 2x of the total population, as the Covid vaccine has more than 1 dose. Regarding only Asia, Singapore leads this with 220.3%.
