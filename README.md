## Project Overview
- Data exploration using Microsoft SQL Server database to answer questions regards infections, deaths and vaccinations. The Dataset was taken from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
- SQL queries available [here](https://github.com/zainsh1/Zain_Covid19/blob/main/sql_queries).
- Visualization the queries in a dashboard using Tableau.


## Objectives
Create a dashboard to visualize, interact and answer those questions:
* What are the numbers globally regards cases and deaths?
* Which continent has been more affected? And which one has more deaths?
* What is the percentage of death by country? How big is this percentage comparing by continent? And what about the infections?
* What's the average percent of population being infected every day?

## Visualizations
The dashboard is available [Covid-19 Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zain.shareef7417/viz/Covid-19Dashboard_16879296650820/Covid-19Dashboard?publish=yes).
* It is possible to filter by continent as well as by country.

## Conclusions
Through the dashboard it can be easily seen:
* Europe has been the most affected continent regards deaths.
* Comparing the entire World, Peru has registered the highest death rate (0.6481%). If it compares only Oceania (for example), New Zealand leads with a death rate of (0.0586%) followed by Australia (0.0814%).
* Comparing the entire World, Cyprus has registered the highest infection rate (73.76%). If it compares only Oceania (for example), New Zealand leads the infection rate (46.23%) followed by Australia at (43.76%).
